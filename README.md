# ESP-SKEL

## About

This repository contain minimal skeletons to start a project using Espressif
development frameworks (e.g. ESP-ADF). This solely exists to make it easier for
us to create minimal code examples when reporting issues upstream.

You are free to use these skeletons as you see fit, but we offer no support
whatsoever. If you have any issues, please read the Espessif documentation.
For this reason, the repository has issues disabled, and we do not accept
pull requests.
